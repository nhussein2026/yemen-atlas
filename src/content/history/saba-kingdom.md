# The Saba Kingdom (10th-6th Century BCE)

## Overview

The Saba Kingdom stands as one of ancient Arabia's greatest civilizations. At its height, Sabean rulers commanded vast territories across southern Arabia, controlled the world's most valuable trade commodity (frankincense), and built engineering marvels that survived for over 1,500 years. The kingdom's influence extended across three continents, connecting Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean world.
